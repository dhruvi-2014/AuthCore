# AuthKernel: Ideation Document

## Vision

Modern applications increasingly rely on identity as a foundational layer rather than a feature. However, most authentication solutions today are tightly coupled with business logic, storage assumptions, or predefined authorization models.

**AuthKernel** is envisioned as a headless authentication core that separates identity verification from authorization decisions. 

Its purpose is to provide a reusable identity layer that can integrate into any backend system without enforcing roles, permissions, or domain-specific logic.

---

## Problem Statement

Most authentication implementations today suffer from one or more of the following limitations:

- **Hardcoded role models** (e.g., admin/user)
- **Tight coupling** with database schemas
- **Inflexible authorization strategies**
- **Vendor lock-in** through hosted identity services
- **Lack of adaptability** across different project types

This results in authentication systems that must be consistently rewritten for different applications, despite solving the exact same core identity problem.

---

## Objective

To design and build a modular authentication engine that:

- Validates identity
- Manages session lifecycle
- Issues secure tokens
- Enables dynamic authorization through external injection

While remaining:
- **Storage-agnostic**
- **Authorization-model neutral**
- **Multi-context ready**

---

## Core Philosophy

AuthKernel treats authentication and authorization as completely separate concerns.

- **Authentication answers:** *Who are you?*
- **Authorization answers:** *What are you allowed to do right now?*

AuthKernel focuses strictly on the first, while enabling the second through carefully designed extensibility.

---

## Design Goals

The system should:

- Operate without assuming roles or permissions
- Support multiple authorization models (RBAC, ABAC, policy-based)
- Remain independent of the underlying storage implementation
- Support multi-tenant or context-based identity configurations
- Enable session-based control alongside stateless access tokens

---

## Architectural Approach

AuthKernel will be built as a modular identity engine consisting of:

1. **Identity Layer** (user verification)
2. **Session Layer** (login lifecycle)
3. **Token Layer** (access & refresh management)
4. **Claims Injection Layer** (external authority mapping)
5. **Policy Evaluation Hook** (external access decisions)

Authorization logic will **not** reside within the core module. Instead, projects integrating AuthKernel will dynamically inject:

- A **claims resolver**
- A **policy resolver**

This allows the exact same authentication engine to adapt across diverse application domains.

---

## Intended Use Cases

AuthKernel should be easily usable across:

- SaaS platforms
- Gaming ecosystems
- Internal enterprise tools
- Multi-tenant systems
- Microservice architectures

...all without requiring any changes to the core authentication logic.

## Long-Term Direction

Future evolution of the platform may include:

- First-class support for external identity providers (OAuth/OIDC)
- Contextual authorization layers
- Built-in observability and telemetry hooks
- Distributed deployment readiness
